<p>Dear Customer:
<p>We're excited to send you our inaugural e-newsletter which includes information about an incredible new technology we now offer. As Colorado's oldest, largest, and most experienced job shop specializing in abrasive waterjet shape cutting, we're thrilled to announce the pending arrival of the Mach 4C Waterjet with Dynamic Waterjet&reg;XD. This unparalleled addition to our breadth of capabilities will allow us to cut virtually any shape on any material in either 2D or 3D using its state of the art five axis capability. And as always, be sure to <b><a href="http://coloradowaterjet.com/contact.php" target="_blank">contact us</a></b> directly to request a quote for your next project or to ask any questions about how the new Mach 4C Waterjet can help your business.

<p><img src="http://coloradowaterjet.com/email/pic1.jpg" border="0" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 10px 10px">Utilizing the most advanced waterjet technology in the industry, the Mach 4C Waterjet with Dynamic Waterjet&reg; XD is designed specifically for unique configurations and customization. This allows us to make even more accurate and efficient cuts, as well as bevel and 3D capabilities, for all of your cutting needs for machine parts, signs, art, and more.</p>
<p>The exclusive HyperPressure Technology includes HyperJet Pumps that are rated for a maximum pressure of 6,500 bar (94,000 psi).

This makes for shorter lead times, higher accuracy, and advanced beveling and 3D capabilities. The revolutionary Dynamic Waterjet&reg; XD also provides for up to 60 degrees of motion, making it capable of cutting virtually any shape on any material in either 2D or 3D. In addition, it automatically compensates for stream lag and taper, natural occurrences in the waterjet process. Still a cold cutting process, this machine raises the standard of excellence in cutting technologies.

<p>Materials that can be cut include: 
<ul style="list-style-image: url(http://coloradowaterjet.com/email/bullet.gif);">
<li>Steel (mild, stainless, tool, high alloy, hardened) 
<li>Aluminum, Titanium, Brass, Copper, Bronze 
<li>Inconel, Hastaloy, Tungsten, Invar, Zirconium 
<li>Marble, Granite, Composites, Plastics, Rubber, Foam <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjHYSqBnzCk" target="_blank"><img src="http://coloradowaterjet.com/email/pic3.jpg" border="0" align="right" style="margin: 0 0 10px 10px"></a>
</ul>
<p>The cutting process is computer numerically controlled and the Mach C4 Waterjet allows us to cut any 2D or 3D design in sheet or plate material. We can work from your computer file, a drawing or a sketch. Preferred format is a .dxf file for 2D and solid model for 3D of the part only, accompanied by a dimensioned drawing (.pdf or .dxf). 
<p>Any size job is welcome, from one piece to thousands.
